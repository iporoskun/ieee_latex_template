# IEEE LaTeX Manuscript Template 

The purpose of this template is to provide a convenient solution for configuring [latex-workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) and git for each manuscript.

The IEEE LaTeX Manuscript Template used in this project was taken from the [IEEE website](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).

### Additional features

+ The inclusion of a `bibliography.tex` file for convenience.
+ The addition of commands such as `\seq`, `\q`, and `\qq`.
+ `settings.json` file that configures [latex-workshop](https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop) to output the PDF and temporary files to the `.\out` folder.

### Copyright

Please note that I do not claim any copyright for the template.
